# SummerJam2017
Theme Bootleg




Ok so on the table immediately I'm planning on making megermhanz 2017, when I heard bootleg I immediately wanted to make it and whatnot. The charm from the game is just so good. 


Whether I end up actually making megermhanz again is a question as mehrio also does sound like an interesting game to make, but regardless that's my plan for now, whether that changes is up to the future. Also it's up to bad coding.


I think I'm going to start with mehrio to gauge enjoyability and then later alter it to megermhanz if need be and if enjoyment is better, but for now yeah.
